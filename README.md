# Django Content Scoring Application

This repository contains a Django application that allows users to score various content items. The application implements a normalization approach to handle the issues of rapidly changing, emotionally driven, or coordinated low scores that may affect content quickly.

## Features

- Create and manage content.
- Users can score content from 0 to 5.
- Get a list of contents with their average scores and individual user scores.
- Normalization logic to prevent rapid score fluctuations from affecting content.

## Installation

To get started with the application, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alrz1999/Django-Demo.git
cd Django-Demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting with Gunicorn

Before starting the application with Gunicorn, run the following commands to apply migrations and collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Then, you can run the application using Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 redit.wsgi:application
```


### Starting with Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can start the application using Docker Compose. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Models

The application contains two main models:

### Content

```python
class Content(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    text = models.TextField()
    score_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    score_sum = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    normalized_score_mean = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
```

- **title**: The title of the content.
- **text**: The text body of the content.
- **score_count**: The total number of scores submitted for the content.
- **score_sum**: The total sum of scores given to the content.
- **normalized_score_mean**: The normalized mean score for the content, calculated using the provided normalization logic.

### ContentScore

```python
class ContentScore(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    score = models.IntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(0), MaxValueValidator(5)])
    scored_at = models.DateTimeField()
```

- **user**: The user who scored the content.
- **content**: The content that was scored.
- **score**: The score given by the user (0-5).
- **scored_at**: The timestamp when the score was given.

## Normalization Logic

In this application, each piece of content has two types of scores:
1. **Exact Score**: The straightforward average score calculated from user submissions.
2. **Normalized Score**: An adjusted score that prevents rapid fluctuations from affecting the content's overall score.

### When Normalization Occurs

Normalization occurs through a Celery cron job that is triggered every hour for items where the difference between the exact score and the normalized score exceeds a predefined threshold.

### Normalization Process

1. **Bucket Scores by Hour**: User scores are grouped into hourly buckets. For each hour, the average score and the total count of scores are computed.
   
2. **Anomaly Filtering with Z-Scores**: Z-scores are calculated for the average scores of the hourly buckets, filtering out any that exceed a predefined threshold.

3. **Calculate the Final Normalized Score**: The final normalized score is computed from the remaining normal buckets, using a weighted average based on score counts.

4. **Update the Normalized Score**: The calculated normalized score is saved and returned as the current score for the content.

## How Z-Scores Handle Anomalies

The Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a score's relationship to the mean of a group of scores. It indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. In this application, Z-scores are utilized to identify and filter out anomalous scores during the normalization process.

### Process:

1. **Calculate Z-Scores**: For the average scores in each hourly bucket, Z-scores are computed. A higher Z-score indicates that the score is significantly different from the average, suggesting it may be an anomaly.

2. **Filter Out Anomalies**: Scores that have a Z-score exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., Â±2.0) are considered outliers and are excluded from the final normalized score calculation. This helps ensure that extreme, potentially coordinated scores do not disproportionately affect the content's overall rating.

By using Z-scores, the application effectively reduces the impact of rapid, emotionally driven, or coordinated scoring, providing a more stable and reliable normalized score for each content item.
